# Ecological Survey of Central Arizona

## todos:

* soil GPS to database
* update all of the old datasets with a pointer to the new, auth. data set, and with temporal coverages
* parcels

## caution:

careful of two AA111 sampling_events in 2000, presumably Jan 01 is wrong as it is a full month before the next survey date and is new year's day
2000-05-01 | AA111
2000-01-01 | AA111

## dataset inventory:

* 282: trees -> update
* 281: soils -> house 2000 soils data
    * data to keep:
    * 27_soil_1.csv
    * 27_soilbulkdensity_1.csv
    * 27_soil_samples_1.csv
    * 27_soil_texture_1.csv
    * 27_soilchemconc_1.csv
    * 27_soilchemmass_1.csv
    * 27_soilncphconduct_1.csv
* 280: shrubs -> update
* 278: will become the data set for one-off, snapshot data (i.e., data that are not part of the long-term effort), including:
    * myco
    * weather
    * dowels
    * traffic
    * pollen (but see 277)
* 277: pollen -> update
* 276: buildings -> update
* 287: neighborhoods -> update
* 272: landuse (MAG) -> update
* 269: landuse history -> no change
* 268: cacti -> update
* 267: sweepnets -> update
* 266: annuals -> update
* 652: new, authoritative data set for ESCA *plots*, including 2015 data (but not survey year 2000 soils)
* 653: new, authoritative data set for ESCA *parcels*, including 2015 data

except for the new, authoritative data sets (knb-lter-cap.652 and knb-lter-cap.653), update means to expand the metadata to include a pointer to the new, authoritative data set, and to imporove the quality of the data and metadata as needed but as minimally as possible to generate a passing data set.

## data entities:

**plots:**

* human indicators
* landscape_irrigation
* vegetation:
    * annuals
    * shrubs_succulents
    * trees
    * counts
    * hedges
* sampling event and site details (bring general_description, and the weather stuff from human_indicators in here)
* arthropods
* buildings
* landuse
* neighborhoods
* soil:
    * center core (including texture 2005-2015)
    * texture 2000 (2000 as a separate data entity)
    * perimeter:
    * raw lachat: have N & P for 2015, and N for 2010
    * raw traacs: P for 2010 

**parcels:**

* vegetation:
    * shrubs_succulents
    * trees
    * counts
    * hedges
* sampling event and site details
* parcel characteristics survey
* landscape_irrigation?
