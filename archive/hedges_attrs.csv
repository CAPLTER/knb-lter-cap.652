The height of plants that are too tall to be measured with a meter tape must be estimated from clinometer measurements. Heights should be calculated as: height (m) = (TAN(height_degree_up)-TAN(height_degree_down)) * height_distance where height_degree_up is the angle in degrees of the top of the plant; height_degree_down is the angle in degrees of the base of the plant; and height_distance is the distance between the plant and surveyor when angles were measured.
